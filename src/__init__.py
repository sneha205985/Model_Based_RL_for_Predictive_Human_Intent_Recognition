"""
Model-Based RL Human Intent Recognition System

A research-grade system combining Gaussian Process dynamics learning, 
Model Predictive Control, and Bayesian Reinforcement Learning for 
human-robot interaction with formal mathematical validation.

Modules:
    models: Human behavior modeling and intent prediction
    controllers: Model Predictive Control implementations
    agents: Bayesian Reinforcement Learning agents
    experimental: Research validation and experimental frameworks
    performance: Performance monitoring and benchmarking
    validation: Mathematical validation and convergence proofs
    utils: Utility functions and logging
    visualization: Plotting and visualization tools
