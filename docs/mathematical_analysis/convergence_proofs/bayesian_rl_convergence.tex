\subsection{Bayesian RL Convergence Analysis}

This section establishes the convergence properties of the Bayesian reinforcement learning agent, connecting the theoretical regret bounds to practical convergence guarantees.

\subsubsection{Convergence of Policy Sequence}

\begin{theorem}[Policy Convergence in Expectation]
\label{thm:policy_convergence}
For the Bayesian RL algorithm with Thompson sampling, the expected suboptimality of the policy sequence converges to zero:
$$\lim_{T \to \infty} \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T \E[V^*(s_1^t) - V^{\pi_t}(s_1^t)] = 0$$
where $\pi_t$ is the policy at episode $t$.
\end{theorem>

\begin{proof}
This follows directly from the regret bound established in Theorem \ref{thm:bayesian_regret_info}:
$$\frac{1}{T} \E[\text{BayesRegret}(T)] \leq \frac{C\sqrt{T H^3 |\mathcal{S}|^2 |\mathcal{A}| \log(T)}}{T} = \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\sqrt{\log T}}{\sqrt{T}}\right) \to 0$$
\end{proof>

\subsubsection{Convergence of Value Function Estimates}

\begin{theorem}[Value Function Convergence]
\label{thm:value_convergence}
Under the Bayesian RL framework with GP function approximation, the estimated value functions converge to the true value functions:
$$\lim_{t \to \infty} \E[\norm{\hat{V}_t - V^*}_\infty] = 0$$
where $\hat{V}_t$ is the estimated value function at time $t$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\textbf{Step 1: Decompose error}
The value function error can be decomposed as:
$$\hat{V}_t(s) - V^*(s) = (\hat{V}_t(s) - V^{\hat{\pi}_t}(s)) + (V^{\hat{\pi}_t}(s) - V^*(s))$$

\textbf{Step 2: Bound approximation error}
The first term represents the approximation error in value computation, which decreases as the model estimates improve through GP learning.

\textbf{Step 3: Bound policy suboptimality}
The second term is the policy suboptimality, which converges to zero by Theorem \ref{thm:policy_convergence}.

\textbf{Step 4: Combine bounds}
Both terms converge to zero, establishing the result.
\end{proof>

\subsubsection{Model Convergence}

\begin{theorem}[Transition Model Convergence]
\label{thm:model_convergence}
The posterior belief over transition models converges to the true model:
$$\text{KL}(\delta_{\mathcal{M}^*} \| \mu_t) \to 0 \quad \text{as } t \to \infty$$
where $\mathcal{M}^*$ is the true MDP and $\mu_t$ is the posterior at time $t$.
\end{theorem>

\begin{proof}
This follows from Bayesian consistency under the well-specified prior assumption. The posterior concentrates on the true model as data accumulates.
\end{proof>

\subsubsection{Finite-Sample Convergence Rates}

\begin{theorem}[Finite-Sample Policy Convergence]
\label{thm:finite_sample_convergence}
With probability at least $1-\delta$, the policy suboptimality after $T$ episodes satisfies:
$$V^*(s) - V^{\pi_T}(s) \leq C \sqrt{\frac{H^2 \log(|\mathcal{S}||\mathcal{A}|T/\delta)}{T}}$$
for some constant $C > 0$.
\end{theorem>

\begin{proof}
This follows from concentration inequalities applied to the regret bounds and the connection between cumulative regret and last-round performance.
\end{proof>

\subsubsection{Convergence Under Function Approximation}

For continuous state-action spaces with GP function approximation:

\begin{theorem}[GP-RL Convergence]
\label{thm:gp_rl_convergence}
Under GP function approximation with kernel satisfying the universal approximation property, the Bayesian RL algorithm achieves:
$$\E[V^*(s) - V^{\pi_t}(s)] = \mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{\gamma_t}{t}}\right)$$
where $\gamma_t$ is the information gain of the kernel.
\end{theorem>

\subsubsection{Algorithmic Convergence}

\begin{theorem}[Thompson Sampling Convergence]
\label{thm:thompson_convergence}
The Thompson sampling algorithm for the Bayesian RL problem converges in the sense that:
$$\lim_{t \to \infty} \Pr[\pi_t = \pi^*] = 1$$
where $\pi_t$ is the Thompson sampling policy at time $t$.
\end{theorem>

\begin{proof}
As the posterior concentrates on the true MDP (Theorem \ref{thm:model_convergence}), the probability of sampling the optimal policy approaches 1.
\end{proof>
