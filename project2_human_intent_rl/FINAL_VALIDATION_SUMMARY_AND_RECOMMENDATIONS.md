**Solution:** 
```bash
# Fix import paths
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)/src
pip install -e .
```
**Time to Fix:** 5 minutes

### **Issue #2: Docker Containerization Missing**
**Problem:** Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml not found
**Impact:** Production deployment convenience (not core functionality)
**Solution:**
- Create basic Dockerfile for containerization
- Add docker-compose.yml for development setup
**Time to Fix:** 15 minutes

### **Issue #3: High-Precision Timer Import**
**Problem:** HighPrecisionTimer class import path issue
**Impact:** Performance monitoring detail level (core monitoring still works)
**Solution:**
```python
# Fix import in comprehensive_benchmarking.py
from .high_precision_timer import HighPrecisionTimer
```
**Time to Fix:** 2 minutes

### **Issue #4: Mathematical Validation Module Path**
**Problem:** Mathematical validation import path incorrect
**Impact:** Automated validation convenience (mathematical proofs still valid)
**Solution:** Update import paths in validation modules
**Time to Fix:** 5 minutes
